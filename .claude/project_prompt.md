# NEMI Project - Auto-Load Context

When starting any new conversation in this project directory:

1. **Read CONTEXT.md immediately** - This file contains the complete project state
2. **Check SESSION HISTORY** in CONTEXT.md to see what was last worked on
3. **Review KNOWN ISSUES** section to understand current blockers
4. **Be proactive** - After loading context, summarize the project status and ask what to work on
